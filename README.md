# 8192cu
Realtek Wireless Network Driver

I didn't write this. All the code in the initial commit came from the 8192cu-dkms Arch Linux User Repository. Any commit afterwards was only intended to be able to get it to compile on my machine. I put it on github just to have a place so I can remember what I did If I need to use this again in teh future.
